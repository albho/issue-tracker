# Issue Tracker
A simple issue tracker for internal use.

### Notable Features:
- Track and update project timelines
  - Add & edit a project's title, description, deadline, team members
- Create & assign tickets
  - Categorize a ticket's type, priority, status, and more
- Authentication (with JWT)
  - Login/Registration form validation
  - Register a company or search for yours to join!

### Current issues:
- Keeping track of user with user ID in local storage - malicious users may pose as other users to make any changes
- Lacking authorization features
- Slow search algorithms (all linear)
